# `org.Personal.Domain` Package

The `org.Personal.Domain` package is organized into three distinct sub-packages: `Mongo`, `Generic`, and `Postgres`. This structure is designed to clearly separate concerns and leverage the strengths of different database technologies for various aspects of the domain model. Below is a breakdown of the purpose and usage of each sub-package.

## Package Overview

### 1. `Mongo`

The `Mongo` package is dedicated to entities and value objects that are specifically managed using MongoDB. MongoDB is a NoSQL database known for its scalability and flexibility, making it well-suited for handling event data.

#### Key Components:

- **Event Entities**: This package houses the domain entities that represent events. Events are stored in MongoDB due to its ability to handle large volumes of data and its flexible schema design.

#### Example:

```java
@Document(collection = "events")
public class Event {
    @Id
    private String id;
    private String type;
    private String description;
    private LocalDateTime timestamp;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

#### Why MongoDB?

MongoDB’s document-oriented nature and scalability make it ideal for managing event data, which can grow rapidly and require flexible schema handling.

### 2. `Generic`

The `Generic` package contains generic conventions and abstractions that are used across different entities and value objects in the domain model. This includes interfaces and base classes that define common properties and behaviors for entities and value objects.

#### Key Components:

- **Entity Interface**: Defines common properties like `creationDate`, `updateDate`, and `isDeleted` for all entities.
- **Value Objects**: Contains value objects that represent immutable data structures used in the domain model.

#### Example:

```java
public interface IEntity {
    LocalDateTime getCreationDate();
    void setCreationDate(LocalDateTime creationDate);
    LocalDateTime getUpdateDate();
    void setUpdateDate(LocalDateTime updateDate);
    boolean isDeleted();
    void setDeleted(boolean deleted);
}
```

#### Purpose:

The `Generic` package provides a consistent set of conventions and abstractions that ensure uniformity across different domain models and facilitate easier management of common properties and behaviors.

### 3. `Postgres`

The `Postgres` package is dedicated to entities and value objects that are managed using PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is a relational database known for its robustness and support for complex queries and transactions.

#### Key Components:

- **Business Objects**: This package houses the domain entities that represent business-related objects. These objects are stored in PostgreSQL due to its strong support for relational data and complex transactions.

#### Example:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private String username;
    private String email;

    // Getters and setters
}
```

#### Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL’s support for advanced querying, strong transactional guarantees, and relational data modeling make it suitable for managing business-related entities that require complex interactions and relationships.

## Summary

The `org.Personal.Domain` package is structured into three sub-packages to leverage the strengths of different database technologies and maintain clear separation of concerns:

- **`Mongo`**: Manages event data using MongoDB’s scalable and flexible schema.
- **`Generic`**: Provides common conventions and abstractions for entities and value objects.
- **`Postgres`**: Manages business-related entities using PostgreSQL’s robust relational database capabilities.

This organization helps ensure that each aspect of the domain model is managed using the most appropriate technology, leading to a more efficient and maintainable codebase.
